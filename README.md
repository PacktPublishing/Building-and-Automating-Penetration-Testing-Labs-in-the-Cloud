This is the code repository for [Building and Automating Penetration Testing Labs in the Cloud](https://www.packtpub.com/product/building-and-automating-penetration-testing-labs-in-the-cloud/9781837632398), published by Packt.

**Set up cost-effective hacking environments for learning cloud security on AWS, Azure, and GCP**

## What is this book about?
The significant increase in the number of cloud-related threats and issues has led to a surge in demand for cloud security professionals. Security professionals planning to advance their careers should know how to set up vulnerable-by-design environments in the cloud to minimize the risks involved while learning cloud penetration testing and ethical hacking.

This step-by-step guide will help you design and build penetration testing labs that mimic modern cloud environments running on AWS, Azure, and GCP. You will learn how to use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) solutions to manage a variety of lab environments in the cloud. You will discover how Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can be leveraged to accelerate the preparation of IaC templates and configurations as well. You will also learn how to validate vulnerabilities by exploiting misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using various penetration testing tools and techniques. In addition to these, you will explore a number of practical strategies on how to manage the complexity, cost, and risks involved when dealing with penetration testing lab environments in the cloud.

By the end of this book, you will be able to design and build cost-effective vulnerable cloud lab environments where you can experiment and practice different types of attacks and penetration testing techniques.

This book covers the following exciting topics: 
* Build vulnerable-by-design labs that mimic modern cloud environments
* Find out how to manage the risks associated with cloud lab environments
* Use infrastructure as code to automate lab infrastructure deployments
* Validate vulnerabilities present in the penetration testing labs
* Find out how to manage the costs of running labs on AWS, Azure, and GCP
* Set up IAM privilege escalation labs for advanced penetration testing
* Use generative AI tools to generate infrastructure as code templates
* Import the Kali Linux Generic Cloud Image to the cloud with ease

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, ch01.

The code will look like the following:
```
module "attacker_vm" {
  source = "./attacker_vm"
}
```
When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items
are set in bold:
```
module "attacker_vm" {
  source = "./attacker_vm"

  𝗺𝘆_𝗽𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗰_𝘀𝘀𝗵_𝗸𝗲𝘆 = 𝘃𝗮𝗿.𝗺𝘆_𝗽𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗰_𝘀𝘀𝗵_𝗸𝗲𝘆
  𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲_𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲_𝗶𝗱 = 𝘃𝗮𝗿.𝗸𝗮𝗹𝗶_𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲_𝗶𝗱
  𝗿𝗴_𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 = 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲.𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲_𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.𝗿𝗴_𝟬𝟮_𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
  𝗿𝗴_𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲 = 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲.𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲_𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.𝗿𝗴_𝟬𝟮_𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲
  𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗻𝗲𝘁 = 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲.𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲_𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗻𝗲𝘁_𝟬𝟮
  𝗮𝘀𝗴 = 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲.𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲_𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.𝗮𝘀𝗴_𝟬𝟮
  𝗻𝘀𝗴 = 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲.𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲_𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.𝗻𝘀𝗴_𝟬𝟮
}
```
