**Set up cost-effective hacking environments for learning cloud security on AWS, Azure, and GCP**

## What is this book about?
The significant increase in the number of cloud-related threats and issues has led to a surge in demand for cloud security professionals. Security professionals planning to advance their careers should know how to set up vulnerable-by-design environments in the cloud to minimize the risks involved while learning cloud penetration testing and ethical hacking.

This step-by-step guide will help you design and build penetration testing labs that mimic modern cloud environments running on AWS, Azure, and GCP. You will learn how to use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) solutions to manage a variety of lab environments in the cloud. You will discover how Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can be leveraged to accelerate the preparation of IaC templates and configurations as well. You will also learn how to validate vulnerabilities by exploiting misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using various penetration testing tools and techniques. In addition to these, you will explore a number of practical strategies on how to manage the complexity, cost, and risks involved when dealing with penetration testing lab environments in the cloud.

By the end of this book, you will be able to design and build cost-effective vulnerable cloud lab environments where you can experiment and practice different types of attacks and penetration testing techniques.

This book covers the following exciting topics: 
* Build vulnerable-by-design labs that mimic modern cloud environments
* Learn how to manage the risks associated with cloud lab environments
* Use Infrastructure-as-Code to automate lab infrastructure deployments
* Validate vulnerabilities present in the penetration testing labs
* Learn how to manage the costs of running labs on AWS, Azure, and GCP
* Set up IAM privilege escalation labs for advanced penetration testing
* Use Generative AI tools to generate Infrastructure-as-Code templates
* Learn how to import the Kali Linux Generic Cloud Image to the cloud
